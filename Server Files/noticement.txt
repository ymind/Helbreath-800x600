New Command just finished today:
/storm magic# amount#
Magic # is the same as the number they are listed
in the magiccfg.txt. Only a few work though.
They are, energy-bolt(10), mass-fire-strike(61),
fire-ball(20), fire-strike(30), lightning(43),
lightning-bolt(51), meteor-strike(81)
bloody-shock-wave(70)

Example, /storm 81 10
That would cause 10 meteors to fall on
your screen. The diameter of the area
they can fall on is the width and height
of your screen. They can do damage and
can even damage GMs. The limit on the
amount# is 30. Anything more will be
automatically set to 30.

These are only the commands we have added.
I would put all the bug fixes but that's not
fun and it's a long list. So enjoy yourself :P
